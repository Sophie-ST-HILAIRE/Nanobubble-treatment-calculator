# Nanobubble treatment calculator: treatment time and costs
This is the repository to the Nanobubble treatment calculator, an app to determine the time nanobubble treatments should be applied to achieve a user specified increase in aquaculture pond water oxygen levels and/or pond water disinfection through ozone nanobubbles. The cost of the treatment is also provided for the user defined input. 

After selecting the purpose of the nanobubble treatment, the user is asked to specify if the energy to power the nanobubbler(s) is supplied via the electric grid or if they are using a rented diesel powered generator. In the event of the electricity supplied from the grid, the price of electricity per kwh can be customized in the "Customization" section of the user input panel.
